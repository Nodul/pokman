# Pokman

a strictly educational project to learn Java+Swing by creating a game 

## TODO

- [ ] manually load placeholder Pokman Sprite
- [ ] add Pokman entity
- [ ] add Pokman controls + actual movement
- [ ] add collision detection (so that Enemies can detect Pokman AND nobody can run into walls)
- [ ] Load SpriteSheet
- [ ] Split and organize SpriteSheet Sprites
- [ ] add Pokman animations (via cycling through imported Sprites)
- [ ] add basic placeholder UI
- [ ] add Enemy entity
- [ ] add varied Enemy behaviour
- [ ] add Pickup entity
- [ ] 5 point pickups + 3 upgrades
- [ ] main menu (new game with map selection, options, exit, credits)
- [ ] add the 4 different maps/sizes
- [ ] polish the game (high score, make resize not break graphics, etc)

## Success:

- [X] init project
- [X] add test walls
- [X] add very basic game loops (with most stuff being a placeholder for now)
- [X] create Map entity
- [X] create a basic debug map 
	- a 12 x 12 map, borders are walls, rest is a floor
- [X] render the map in Swing
